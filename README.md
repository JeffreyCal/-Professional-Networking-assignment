# -Professional-Networking-assignment

#### This project was my most recent assignment in cs234, which is a class that teaches Java. For this assignments, we had to create a parent class with subclasses that inherited certain traits of the parent class, as well as some other task.
#### The first class, titled Pet, is the parent class of this situation. Afterwards I delcared my variables, which included the Name, Type, BirthDate, Owner, Weight, Sex, and Color which will later be used for the pets.
